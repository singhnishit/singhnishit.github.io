Hey! I am a student of physics and engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITS_Pilani) and am (largely) interested in quantum computing and information. My motivation lies in utilising my background in mechanical engineering to design cryogenic systems for the housing and control of quantum computers, as well as use my background in physics to help design state of the art processors and algorithms.

I have previously worked at the [Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research) as a student research intern. My thesis was on the design and synthesis of oleophobic surface microstructures at extremely high temperatures at the National Materials Science Laboratory. I am currently working under [Dr. Gaurav Sharma](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/gaurav-sharma/) on an FEA solver for fluid structure interaction. I have worked with him previously on energy harvesting methods.

I have had stints at the [Postman Innovation Laboratory]() and [Kalipatnapu Extended Reality Labs]() where I worked on quantum mechanical and complex system simulations and procedural and generative 3D model creation respectively. A more exhaustive list of projects can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/singhnishit) as well as my CV.

I like to read a lot, with Infinite Jest (David Foster Wallace) being my current favourite book, with Catch-22 (Joseph Heller) and the Dune saga (Frank Herbert) being close runner ups. I also like to run.

If you would like to say hi, I am most responsive on [email](f20221317@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in).
